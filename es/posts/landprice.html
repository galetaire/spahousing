<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
  For measuring urban land price, we have used a weighted value based on the urban land price of municipalities
  provided by the
  <a href="https://www.mitma.gob.es/el-ministerio/informacion-estadistica/vivienda-y-actuaciones-urbanas/estadisticas/suelo/estadisticas-de-precios-de-suelo-urbano" target="_blank">MITMA</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The weighted value is the outcome of using the <em>average price of the last 15 years</em> and the
  <em>average price of the last 5 years</em>, in order to have a value that captures both its current price
  and its price tendency. Being the formula as follows:
</p>

<p>Data sample for better understanding:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Spanish region</th>
      <th>Municipalities by inhabitants</th>
      <th>Average price last 15 years</th>
      <th>Average price last 5 years</th>
      <th>Weighted price value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Andalusia</td>
      <td>From 1000 to 5000</td>
      <td>110.3</td>
      <td>116.4</td>
      <td>122.1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Andalusia</td>
      <td>From 5000 to 10000</td>
      <td>128.3</td>
      <td>116.5</td>
      <td>104.8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Commentary for the data sample</strong>: Even if both prices are similar (around 116 euros per square meter), the weighted value for municipalities from 1000 to 5000 is higher because the price pressure went upward over the last 15 years. In contrast, municipalities from 5000 to 10000 have a lower value because the pressure went downward.</p>

<p>
  Because the data provided by the MITMA is grouped by the size of municipalities, it causes some municipalities,
  such as MÃ¡laga (Andalusia), Barcelona (Catalonia) or Valldemossa (Mallorca), to have a lower value than expected.
  In order to tame this issue, we have used the average net income per person as a corrector.
</p>

<p>
  The corrector relies on the average income per person from each municipality, which is divided by the national
  average income per person (12,982 euros per year).
</p>

<p>The result is then used as a multiplier. Data sample for better understanding:</p>

      <th>Income corrector</th>
      <th>Land price value</th>

    <tr>
      <td>Barcelona</td>
      <td>233</td>
      <td>1.35</td>
      <td>314.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sant Antoni de Portmany</td>
      <td>339</td>
      <td>0.98</td>
      <td>332.2</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Notes on the use of urban land price as an scarcity index</h2>
<p>
  In a market where supply and demand interact freely, <strong>prices tend to reflect the relative scarcity of goods</strong>.
  When a good is scarce and in high demand, its price is likely to increase. Conversely, if a good is abundant
  or there is low demand for it, the price may decrease. Based on this principle, we could use
  <strong>the price as a measure to approximate urban land scarcity</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  It is important to note that <strong>price should not be seen as perfect information, since we do not live
  in a perfect free market</strong>, and other factors also affect prices, such as government regulations,
  government subsidies, price controls, money creation, public or private monopolies, market speculation,
  branding, advertising, and other market interventions.
