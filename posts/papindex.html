<p>
  The PAP is an index that draws two ceilings based on demographics. The idea is to model rational demand based on population<sup>[1]</sup>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assuming that every 1 person needs 1 house, that would be the demographic upper limit of purchases.</li>
  <li>Assuming that humans mate, then each couple (2 people) would need 1 house, that would be the lower limit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How are the limits created?</h2>

<p>
  The demographic limits are created by considering the number of people between 25 and 50 years of age on a given year, and then this limits can be crossed with the number of sales or mortgages for the same year.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The upper bound is the total number of people between 25 and 50 divided by 26 (the total number of age groups).
  </li>

  <li>
    The lower bound is the upper bound divided by 2 (simulates the potential number of couples).

</ul>

<h2>Why the range between 25 and 50 years of age?</h2>

<p>
  The logic comes from a decision to avoid "noise" in the data. Around 70% of purchases are concentrated in this age group
  (<em>example source</em>:
  <a href="https://es.statista.com/estadisticas/937303/porcentaje-de-compradores-de-viviendas-por-grupo-de-edad-espana/" target="_blank">Statista</a>).
  The approximate landscape is the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Age group between 0 - 24, represents 24% of the population and 5% of purchases.</li>
  <li>Age group between 25 - 50, represents 35% of the population and 70% of purchases.</li>
  <li>Age group between 51 - 1xx, represents 41% of the population and 25% of purchases.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The bands could move especially upwards, towards 60 years of age. Actually, the values for the limits using the age group between 25 - 60 has been reviewed and is available in the public database. But the values do not vary significantly from those shown by the 25 - 50 group, and only serve to flatten the curve, which we interpret as noise.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, the 25 - 50 age bracket occupies the majority of purchases providing the least noise.

<h2>Other notes</h2>

<p>
  For the mathematical notations, the
  <a href="https://math.vercel.app/home" target="_blank">Latex Math API</a> developed by
  <a href="https://twitter.com/uechz" target="_blank">@uechz</a> has been used. A latex editor is accessible at
  <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/latex_equation_editor.htm" target="_blank">TutorialsPoint.com</a>.
</p>
<p><small>  <sup>[1]</sup> However, this index is far from achieving a perfect demand side. We must consider that 85% of purchases come from individuals, but 15% are from legal entities (not considered in the demographic curve). Also, purchases made by foreign non-residents are not considered either in the demographic limits.</small></p>
