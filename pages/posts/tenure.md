# Housing by type of tenure

[![Régimen de tenencia de la vivienda](/images/tenure.png)](/images/tenure.png)

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the distribution (%) of homes according to whether the house is owned (fully paid), owned but mortgaged, rented or freely loaned. Thus, we can see the structure of ownership in Spain. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Fully owned houses is the prime tenure in Spain.
- **Observation B**: Since 2013 the number of mortgaged houses has been decreasing, hence we should expect an uptrend in full ownership in the future.
- **Observation C**: Since 2013 freely loaned houses have increased the most (in relative numbers), still is the least frequent type of tenure. These loans are made normally between family members.
- **Observation D**: Rented houses have slightly increased on the last 7 years.
