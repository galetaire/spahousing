# Housing by type of tenure

![Reload chart](/images/tenure.png)

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the distribution (%) of homes according to whether the house is owned (fully paid), owned but mortgaged, rented or freely loaned (usually by a relative). Thus, we can see the structure of ownership in Catalonia. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Fully owned houses is the prime tenure in Catalonia.
- **Observation B**: Since 2013 the number of mortgaged houses has been decreasing (-7% on the last 7 years), hence we should expect an uptrend in full ownership in the future.
- **Observation C**: Since 2013 freely loaned houses have increased the most (in relative numbers), with a 30% increase on the last 7 years, still is the least frequent type of tenure. These loans are made normally between family members.
- **Observation D**: Rented houses have increased by a 14% on the last 7 years, getting close to overtake mortgaged houses. Seems that population is changing its preference onto renting and not mortgaging, maybe due to free choice, or because of the difficulties for accessing to mortgages.
