- **Left axis**: HPI (Housing Price Index) not inflation adjusted (base 100 = 2015).
- **Right axis**: average unemployment rate for each quarter.

# Interpretation and observations

The relationship between unemployment and price is negative. When the unemployment rate rises, housing prices fall, and vice versa. This behaviour repeats clearly over time. If we look at the chart above we can distinguish several outstanding periods:

- 1986 - 1990: Unemployment falls, housing prices rise.
- 1991 - 1996: Unemployment rises, housing prices fall.
- 1997 - 2006: Unemployment falls, housing prices rise.
- 2007 - 2013: Unemployment rises, housing prices fall.
- 2014 - 2020: Unemployment falls, housing prices rise.
