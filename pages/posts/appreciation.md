- **Bars**: green bars denote positive percentage appreciation, and red bars denote negative percentage appreciation.

- **Housing ROI (%)**: final return on investment, considering both net rental return and net asset appreciation.

# Interpretation and observations

The first chart from above shows the gross nominal annual appreciation of housing, i.e. whether if houses increases or decreases in value year over year (it does not consider rental returns). We can distinguish several outstanding periods:

- 1986 - 1990: Strong revaluation.
- 1991 - 1993: Stagnation.
- 1994 - 2007: Steady revaluation.
- 2008 - 2013: Strong devaluation.
- 2014 - 2021: Moderate revaluation.

The second chart shows the final net return on investment, considering both net rental return and net asset appreciation.

- **Price-to-rent ratio (time, net and gross)**: number of years to fully recover a home purchase in Spain.

# Interpretation and observations

The charts from above show the ratio between the purchase price and the rental price (both in %; and in time, years). In essence, it's an indicator similar to the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) used in the stock market analysis. It can be interpreted on the following way:

- At 2010 prices, it took 26.1 years to fully recover a house purchase through rental returns, at a 3.8% annual rental return.
- At 2020 prices, it took 16.4 years to fully recover a house purchase through rental returns, at a 6.1% annual rental return.
