# Interpretation and observations

The first chart from above shows the gross nominal annual appreciation of housing, i.e. whether if houses increases or decreases in value year over year (it does not consider rental returns). We can distinguish several outstanding periods:

- 1986 - 1990: Strong revaluation.
- 1991 - 1993: Stagnation.
- 1994 - 2007: Steady revaluation.
- 2008 - 2013: Strong devaluation.
- 2014 - 2021: Moderate revaluation.

The second chart shows the final net return on investment, considering both net rental return and net asset appreciation.
