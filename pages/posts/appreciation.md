# Housing yearly appreciation in nominal value

![Reload chart](/images/rendibilitat.png)

- **Bars**: green bars denote positive percentage appreciation, and red bars denote negative percentage appreciation.
- **Red line**: annual inflation rate, represented in percentage.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the nominal annual appreciation of housing, i.e. whether if houses increases or decreases in value year over year (it does not consider rental returns, neither is inflation adjusted). We can distinguish several outstanding periods:

- 1986 - 1990: Strong revaluation.
- 1991 - 1993: Stagnation.
- 1994 - 2007: Steady revaluation.
- 2008 - 2014: Strong devaluation.
- 2015 - 2021: Slight revaluation.
