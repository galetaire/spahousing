[![Salarios y precio de la vivienda](/images/wageyearly.png)](/images/wageyearly.png)

- **Ideal wage disconnection (in percentage)**: the ideal wage is defined as "the wage that allows you to completely pay off your mortgage with 5 years of full wage". E.g., if the value equals 30, it means that wages must increase by 30% to match the ideal wage.

- **Housing affordability (Base 100=1999)**: Spain housing affordability index. It considers income growth against housing and inflation growth.

# Interpretation and observations

The first chart from above shows the housing cycles by looking at wages. In this sense, it is common to found convergence and divergence cycles. Divergence implies that housing prices grow faster than wages, and convergence the opposite.

- 2003 - 2007: Wage/price divergence.
- 2008 - 2013: Wage/price convergence.
- 2014 - 2021: Wage/price divergence.
