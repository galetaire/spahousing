# Wages and housing affordability

[![Salarios y precio de la vivienda](/images/sou.png)](/images/sou.png)

- **Left axis (bars)**: wages. The standard wage represents the median of the salaries distribution in Spain, in euros. Data for 2020 and 2021 are still pending official confirmation, instead, household disposable income has been used for the projection.
- **Right axis (line)**: average mortgage amount, Spain, in euros.

- **Ideal wage disconnection (in percentage)**: the ideal wage is defined as "the wage that allows you to completely pay off your mortgage with 5 years of full wage". E.g., if the value equals 30, it means that wages must increase by 30% to match the ideal wage.

- **Housing affordability (Base 100=1999)**: Spain housing affordability index. It considers income growth against housing and inflation growth.

# Interpretation and observations

The first chart from above shows the housing cycles by looking at wages. In this sense, it is common to found convergence and divergence cycles. Divergence implies that housing prices grow faster than wages, and convergence the opposite.

- 2003 - 2007: Wage/price divergence.
- 2008 - 2013: Wage/price convergence.
- 2014 - 2021: Wage/price divergence.
