# Demographic rhythm and home sales: the PAP housing index

![Reload chart](/images/demografia.png)

- **Purchasing-age population (PAP)**: Home sales (bars); population between 25 and 50 years old (dotted lines); and housing inheritances (purple line).

- **PAP disaggregated**: Home sales (bars); population of 35, 40 and 45 years old (colored dotted lines); and housing inheritances (purple line).

# Interpretation and observations

The _PAP housing index_ is an indicator to analyze the housing market condition. It draws two ceilings based on demographics. The higher one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house individually, and the lower one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house as a couple.

- If the number of sales exceeds the upper limit, it implies that the situation corresponds to a **bubble**, e.g. 2003 - 2006.
- If the number of sales is below the lower limit, it implies that there is a **depression**, e.g. 2009 - 2014.
- If the number of sales is in between the two ceilings, it implies that the market is in an **optimal zone**. Being possible to denote a **bull trend** (if the bars are above the optimal line), or a **bear trend** (if the bars are below the optimal line).
