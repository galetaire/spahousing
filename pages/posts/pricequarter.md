# Quarterly evolution of housing prices

![Reload chart](/images/preu.png)

- **Left axis (line)**: house price in euros per square meter, according to Idealista and to the notaries.
- **Right axis (area)**: Percentage of difference (in absolute value) between the two compared price sources.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above compares Idealista and notary prices. Both trends are very similar. However, the notary price tends to be always below the Idealista price. This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the Idealista price shows the price proposed by the seller, while the notary price shows the price actually paid by the buyer.

Another important point in interpreting the graph is the _"Spread"_ and the _"Sharp change"_, which are intended to serve as signals to capture trend changes.

- **Differential**: The grey bars (right axis) simply show the difference between the two prices in %. The two lines should not be too far apart, as they represent the same information. Therefore, when the difference is too large, probably one of the two sources is getting the trend wrong.

- **Sharp change**: The green line (with the error bars) show the variation of the notarial price compared to the Idealista trend. The line can move away from the Idealista price both upwards and downwards. For example, in 2010-2012 there are a couple of very visible moments when it moves clearly downwards, suggesting that the downward pressure is strong.
