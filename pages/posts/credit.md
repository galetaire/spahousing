- **Ratio between mortgages and home sales**: if the ratio is (x), it means there a (x) mortgages per each (1) home sale.

# Interpretation and observations

Credit correlates positively with the evolution of housing prices. Some brief observations:

- **Observation A**: Mortgage approvals were huge in the early 2000s. Far above the demographic upper limit, indicating the creation of a bubble.
- **Observation B**: The average mortgage amount follows an uptrend, consequence of the inflationary monetary policy. Although corrections can occur when a credit bubble burst.
- **Observation C**: The real credit movement (second chart) allow us to see the credit/debt cycles.
- **Observation D**: About the ratio (third chart). If it is greater than 1, there are more mortgages than home sales, indicating the danger of a credit bubble. If it is less than 1, there are more home sales (cash purchases) than mortgages.
