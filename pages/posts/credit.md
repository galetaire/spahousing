- **Ratio between mortgages and home sales**: if the ratio is (x), it means there a (x) mortgages per each (1) home sale.

# Interpretation and observations

Credit correlates very well with the evolution of house prices. As an example, we will make a couple of interpretations:

- **Observation A**: We can observe how mortgage approvals were huge in the early 2000s. Far above the demographic upper limit, indicating the creation of a bubble. Currently, mortgage approvals are within the lower limit zone.
- **Observation B**: The average mortgage amount follows an uptrend. This is a consequence of inflation, being the reason why within the general collective there is the thinking of _"housing always goes up"_, which has it's part of truth.
- **Observation C**: Although the average mortgage amount tends upwards, there are corrections. The most important happened in the year 2007-2013.
- **Observation D**: The real credit movement (second chart) allow us to see the credit/debt cycles.
- **Observation E**: About the ratio (third chart). If it is greater than 1, there are more mortgages than home sales, indicating the danger of a credit bubble. If it is less than 1, there are more home sales than mortgages, indicating that cash purchases are gaining strength.
