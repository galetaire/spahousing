# (a) Annual evolution of mortgages

[![Hipotecas en España](/images/credityearly.png)](/images/credityearly.png)

- **Left axis (bars)**: annual number of mortgages approved and released.
- **Right axis (line)**: average annual mortgage amount, in euros.

- **Real credit movement (mortgages), in percentage**: blue = real credit expansion; orange = real credit contraction.

- **Ratio between mortgages and home sales**: if the ratio is (x), it means there a (x) mortgages per each (1) home sale.

# Interpretation and observations

Credit correlates positively with the evolution of housing prices. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Mortgage approvals were far above the demographic upper limit in the 2000s.
- **Observation B**: The average mortgage amount follows an uptrend, although corrections can occur.
- **Observation C**: The real credit movement allow us to see the debt cycles.
- **Observation D**: the ratio _Mortgages/Sales_ hints the formation of real estate bubbles.

# (b) Euribor and interest rates

[![Euribor y interes hipotecas](/images/euribor.png)](/images/euribor.png)

- **Left axis (%)**: Euribor 1-year average rate and average mortgage rate.
- **Right axis (e/m2)**: house price in euros per square meter.

- **Mortgages constituted according to type of interest rate (%)**: fixed or variable.

# Interpretation and observations

The _Euro Interbank Offered Rate_ (Euribor) plays a key role in the mortgage market. An increase of the Euribor implies an increase in mortgage rates, which if sustained for longer periods, constraints the debt capacity for borrowers, resulting in general price stagnation due to the lack of new money flowing into the system, or even price regression if there is an excessive amount of credit accumulated (credit bubble).
