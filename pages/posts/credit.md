- **Stacked bars (100%)**: Blue = average annual mortgage amount; Orange = average annual housing price.

# Interpretation and observations

Credit correlates very well with the evolution of house prices. As an example, we will make a couple of interpretations:

- **Observation A**: We can observe how mortgage approvals were huge in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Far above the demographic upper limit, indicating the creation of a bubble.
- **Observation B**: Currently, mortgage approvals is within the demographic limit, in fact it is closer to the lower limit zone. In other words, there is no credit bubble.
- **Observation C**: The average mortgage amount follows an uptrend. This is a consequence of inflation, being the reason why within the general collective there is the thinking of _"housing always goes up"_, which has it's part of truth.
- **Observation D**: Although the average mortgage amount tends upwards, there are corrections. The most important happened in the year 2007-2012.
- **Observation E**: The health crisis of the Covid-19, in the year 2020, also seems to be causing a correction, which could indicate a housing prices correction.
- **Observation F**: The stacked bars (second chart) allow us to see which of the two variables dominate, price or credit. It also tells us when the variables show different trends, which usually means a change of cycle.
