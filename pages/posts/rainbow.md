# Demographic model: housing cycles

[![Ciclos inmobiliarios](/images/rainbowmax.png)](/images/rainbowmax.png)

- **Color range interpretation** ➞ **Red** = strong overprice; **Orange** = slightly overprice; **Yellow** = neutral; **Green** = slightly underprice; **Blue** = strong underprice.

```
This is an experimental indicator, open to improvements and corrections.
Must be read as an informative indicator, not a scientific measure.
```

The rainbow curve describes a demographic band, which, overlapped with the real price, evaluates the stage of the price cycle. A few notes and considerations:

- The real price data is derived from an alternative formula, [real price notes](realprice).
- The rainbow curve is a trendline equation derived from the demographic curve (quadratic function).
- The derived rainbow curve has been price-adjusted, in order to fit properly with the price pattern.
- The central line (yellow) is the reference trendline, adding an equidistant band until it convers most peaks and troughs.
