# Measuring house scarcity using the number of inhabitants per dwelling

Measuring house scarcity is not a straightforward task, as multiple factors can come into play. The most intuitive indicator, however, is the number of dwellings per person.

| 🟨 | Medium scarcity | There is one house for each 2.00 - 2.49 people |
| 🟥 | High scarcity | There is one house for each 2.50 - 3.48 people |
