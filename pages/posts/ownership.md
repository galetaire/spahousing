# (a) Home sales by type of buyer

[![Nacionalidad de los compradores de vivienda](/images/buyer.png)](/images/buyer.png)

The chart from above shows the distribution (%) of home sales according to whether the buyer is national, foreigner or a legal entity (companies, investment funds ...). Thus, we can see who dominates and who departs the market. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: between 2011 and 2013 the weight of legal entities expanded, which can be interpreted as (1) an interest by investment funds, and (2) an increase in foreclosures.
- **Observation B**: between 2014 and 2020, the weight of foreign population has consolidated at around 10%. This includes both resident and non-resident foreigners.

# (b) Housing by type of tenure

[![Régimen de tenencia de la vivienda](/images/tenure.png)](/images/tenure.png)

The chart from above shows the distribution (%) of homes according to whether the house is owned (fully paid), owned but mortgaged, rented or freely loaned. Thus, we can see the structure of ownership in Spain. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: fully owned houses is the prime tenure in Spain.
- **Observation B**: since 2013 the number of mortgaged houses has been decreasinge.
- **Observation C**: rented houses have increased slightly on the last 7 years.
- **Observation D**: since 2013 freely loaned houses have increased the most (in relative numbers). These loans are made normally between family members.
