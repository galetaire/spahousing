# (a) Home sales by type of buyer

[![Nacionalidad de los compradores de vivienda](/images/buyer.png)](/images/buyer.png)

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the distribution (%) of home sales according to whether the buyer is national, foreigner or a legal entity (companies, investment funds ...). Thus, we can see who dominates, and who departs the market. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Between 2011 and 2013 the weight of legal entities expanded a lot, which can be interpreted (1) as an interest by investment funds (which considered the prices a good opportunity), and (2) as an increase in foreclosures, where banks absorbed evicted properties.
- **Observation B**: Between 2014 and 2020, the weight of foreign population has consolidated at around 10%. This includes both resident and non-resident foreigners.

# (b) Housing by type of tenure

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the distribution (%) of homes according to whether the house is owned (fully paid), owned but mortgaged, rented or freely loaned. Thus, we can see the structure of ownership in Spain. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Fully owned houses is the prime tenure in Spain.
- **Observation B**: Since 2013 the number of mortgaged houses has been decreasing, hence we should expect an uptrend in full ownership in the future.
- **Observation C**: Since 2013 freely loaned houses have increased the most (in relative numbers), still is the least frequent type of tenure. These loans are made normally between family members.
- **Observation D**: Rented houses have slightly increased on the last 7 years.
