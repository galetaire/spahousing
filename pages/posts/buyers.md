# Home sales by type of buyer

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the distribution (%) of home sales according to whether the buyer is national, foreigner or a legal entity (companies, investment funds ...). Thus, we can see who dominates, and who departs the market. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Between 2011 and 2013 the weight of legal entities expanded a lot, which can be interpreted (1) as an interest by investment funds (which considered the prices a good opportunity), and (2) as an increase in foreclosures, where banks absorbed evicted properties.
- **Observation B**: Between 2014 and 2020, the weight of foreign population has consolidated at around 10%. This includes both resident and non-resident foreigners.
