# About the population

The population data is properly documented by the INE from 1964 onwards, but in order to approximate the population growth between 1900 and 1963, the reference data used has been also the historical series provided by the INE (_Instituto Nacional de Estadística_). Link source:

- [Series históricas 1900-2001: Población por sexo y edad - Datos censales](https://www.ine.es/censo2001/historia.htm).

Since the data provided by the INE only corresponds to data from the beginning of each decade (1900, 1910, 1920...), data from the work from _Roser Nicolau_ has also been used to approximate the population for each of the years between 1900 and 1963.

The data presented by _Roser Nicolau_ uses the mentioned historical data by the INE too, but does a deeper sourcing work in trying to provide better accuracy on the Spanish demography. Link source:

- ["_Estadisticas Historicas de España, siglo XIX - XX_" (2005, second edition), chapter 2: _Población, salud y actividad_, by Roser Nicolau, Page 124, Cuadro 2.5. Book coordinated by Albert Carreras and Xavier Tafunell, Fundación BBVA, ISBN: 84‑96515‑00‑1](https://www.fbbva.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dat/DE_2006_estadisticas_historicas.pdf).

The next table shows a comparison of the data from the INE, Roser Nicolau estimations and our own estimations:

| Year | Estadistica Padrón Continuo (INE) | Roser Nicolau estimation| Our estimation |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| 1900 | 18.618.086 | 18.566.000 | 18.618.086 |
| 1910 | 19.995.686 | 19.858.000 | 19.995.686 |
| 1920 | 21.389.842 | 21.232.000 | 21.389.842 |
| 1930 | 23.677.794 | 23.445.000 | 23.677.794 |
| 1940 | 26.015.907 | 25.757.000 | 25.415.907 |
| 1950 | 27.976.755 | 27.868.000 | 27.976.755 |
| 1960 | 30.528.539 | 30.303.000 | 30.528.539 |

We respected the data provided by the INE for the beginning of each decade, with the only difference existing in the year 1940, were we reduced the estimated population in comparison to the one provided by the INE, and also being less than Nicolau's estimates.

The reason for downgrading the 1940 data is related to the Spanish Civil War. Although most estimates prefer not to infer population loss caused by the war, even official sources of the time assume a population loss at least in 1939:

| Year | Births | Deaths | Natural change |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| 1936 | 613.691 | 413.579 | 200.112 |
| 1937 | 565.801 | 472.134 | 93.667 |
| 1938 | 506.120 | 484.940 | 21.180 |
| 1939 | 419.848 | 470.114 | -50.266 |

- [_"Movimiento Natural de la Población de España, año 1939_"(1943), done by Talleres del Instituto Geográfico y Catastral, Ministerio de Trabajo, Direccion General de Estadistica, Madrid](https://www.ine.es/inebase_historia/1939.pdf).

We do not venture to assume any sort of population loss either, even if it is highly probable at least in 1939 (even more so if we consider migratory movements), but what we do consider reasonable referring to the _Movimiento Natural de la Población de España, año 1939_, is that in any case population growth suffered a fall compared to previous years in 1937, 1938 and 1939.

# About the housing stock

The Spanish Government has adequately documented housing stock data from 2001 onwards. However, to approximate housing growth between 1900 and 2000, we relied on several sources.

From 1970 to 2000, we utilized data sourced from the _Atlas Digital de las Áreas Urbanas_ (_Parque de Viviendas > Viviendas según tipo > Viviendas familiares > Select from available years 1970, 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011 > Tabla and Sintesis_): [Link](https://atlasau.mitma.gob.es/#c=indicator&view=map1). Its database provides housing stock figures for the years 1970, 1981, 1991 and 2001, with data sourced from the INE (_Censo de Población y Vivienda_) according to its notes.

However, data for the years in between (1971, 1972...1980...1994...2000) are not available. To fill these gaps, we relied on estimates provided by the _Banco de España_, which covers the period from 1981 to 2000 (_Observatorio de Vivienda y Suelo > Boletines periódicos > Boletín Anual 2021 > Tabla 8.1_): [Link](https://www.mivau.gob.es/urbanismo-y-suelo/suelo/observatorio-de-vivienda-y-suelo). We made slight adjustments to ensure consistency across our comprehensive dataset. For comparison, here are some sample figures:

| Year | Bank of Spain estimation| Our estimation |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| 1970 | No data | 10.659.882 |
| 1981 | 14.860.272 | 14.726.000 |
| 1991 | 17.336.208 | 17.206.000 |
| 2001 | 21.025.227 | 21.033.759 |

From 1900 to 1970 we have made our own estimations based in data collected by _Xavier Tafunell (2005)_ in:

- ["_Estadisticas Historicas de España, siglo XIX - XX_" (2005, second edition), chapter 6: _Urbanización y vivienda_, by Xavier Tafunell, Page 491, Cuadro 6.7 and Cuadro 6.6. Book coordinated by Albert Carreras and Xavier Tafunell, Fundación BBVA, ISBN: 84‑96515‑00‑1](https://www.fbbva.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dat/DE_2006_estadisticas_historicas.pdf).

From 1950 onward, we replicated the data from _Tafunell (2005, page 491, table 6.7)_, incorporating minor adjustments to ensure consistency across our comprehensive dataset, which integrates information from multiple sources. As means of comparison, here there is a sample from  _Xavier Tafunell_ and our own estimation:

| Year | Xavier Tafunell estimation| Our estimation |
| ---- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1900 | 1.879.400 | 2.900.608 |
| 1910 | 2.023.600 | 3.283.754 |
| 1920 | 2.243.000 | 3.704.853 |
| 1930 | 2.644.700 | 4.261.352 |
| 1940 | 3.106.400 | 5.003.585 |
| 1950 | 6.287.490 | 6.003.353 |
| 1960 | 7.710.522 | 7.622.423 |
| 1970 | 10.655.814 | 10.659.882 |

A discrepancy in the sample can be observed between 1900 and 1940. This is because, prior to 1950, _Tafunell_ research only reports housing stock from urban areas, not being able to find reliable sources for rural areas (page 490, table 6.6, _"Parque estimado de viviendas en núcleos urbanos por provincias, 1860 - 1950"_).

The lack of reliable sources for rural areas is unfortunate, as we consider housing in rural areas to be quite relevant for obtaining a comprehensive historical overview. If we accept the figure of 1,879,400 houses in 1900 as accurate, the annual construction estimates from 1900 to 1950 would yield improbable values given the resources and means of production available during that period. To address this data gap, we had to walk on thin ice.

According to research conducted by the [_Centre d'Estudis Demogràfics_](https://ced.cat/) [(2)](https://exploradorsocial.es/ojo-al-dato-asi-evoluciono-el-tamano-de-los-hogares-en-mas-de-100-anos/), the number of households in the year 1900 is estimated to be around 4.8 million.

For our estimations, we assumed that the actual housing stock in 1900 should have probably been somewhere in between 1.8 million, being the urban housing stock reported by _Tafunell_ the minimum, and 4.8 million, being the number of households reported by _Centre d'Estudis Demogràfics_ the maximum.

Further accuracy is needed since the gap between those two values is significant. To enhance accuracy, we sought guidance from the buildings per period of construction dataset (_Viviendas principales por zona y tamaño del municipio, comunidades autónomas y provincias y periodo de construcción del edificio (antes de 1900 a 1950)_): [Link](https://www.ine.es/jaxi/Tabla.htm?path=/t20/e242/e04/a1991/l0/&file=01002.px&L=0)

Based on this data, between 1900 and 1920, 61% of houses were in urban areas, while 39% were in rural areas. Running the numbers, if there were 1.8 million urban houses in 1900, and these represented 61% of the total stock, then the total would be around 2.9 million houses. Since 2.9 million falls into our considered range, we have assumed this value to be the best approximation we could get.

Then, having 2.9 million houses in 1900 as our starting point, one of the last variables we considered for our estimations was the number of people employed in the construction sector, from the historical research conducted by _Leandro Prados de la Escosura (2017_), found in:

-  _Spanish Economic Growth, 1850-2015, London: Palgrave Macmillan_, spreadsheets and extensive data available in [frdelpino.es](https://frdelpino.es/investigacion/category/01_ciencias-sociales/01_economia-espanola/02_economia-espanola-perspectiva-historica/).

We utilized the number of people employed in the construction sector (_Leandro Prados de la Escosura,2017_) as a proxy to estimate the number of houses that could have been built each year within the considered range, using the isolated data points collected from several sources as anchors (_Atlas Digital de las Áreas Urbanas_, _Banco de España_, _Xavier Tafunell_ and _Centre d'Estudis Demogràfics_, including our base estimation for the year 1900).

The main question we faced was determining the labour input per unit of output. We have reliable governmental data from 1990 onwards, but the variance is substantial, ranging from 3.3 workers per house constructed in the year 2000 to 14 workers per house constructed in 2020, making accurate estimation challenging.

| Year | Employed in construction | Workers needed per home | Inhabitants per home |
| ---- | ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1970 | - | - | 3,17 |
| 1980 | - | - | 2,59 |
| 1990 | 1.276.000 | 3,9 | 2,30 |
| 2000 | 1.722.000 | 3,3 | 1,95 |
| 2010 | 1.651.000 | 8,3 | 1,85 |
| 2020 | 1.244.100 | 14,0 | 1,83 |

The best proxy we identified is linked to demography, particularly the number of inhabitants and the fertility rate. As shown in the previous table, the number of inhabitants per home has been steadily decreasing over the last 50 years (source: INE). It is reasonable to assume that the number of inhabitants per home would have been higher the further back in time we go.

In this sense, examining the household size should provide us with a clue. However, it is important to note that household size and inhabitants per home are different measures. Inhabitants per home is simply the population divided by the number of houses, whereas household size is more connected to interfamily relations, making it possible to have multiple households in the same house.

According to the [_Centre d'Estudis Demogràfics_](https://ced.cat/) [(2)](https://exploradorsocial.es/ojo-al-dato-asi-evoluciono-el-tamano-de-los-hogares-en-mas-de-100-anos/) and [_Fernando Mikelarena Peña_](https://www.historiaagraria.com/FILE/articulos/HA3_mikelarena.pdf) the average household size was around 4.8 people per household in the 1900s.

Recently, [_CaixaBank Research_](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/sector-analysis/real-estate/what-big-data-reveal-about-spains-supply-new-housing-and-demographic) indicated that between 2020 and 2022, around 420,000 new households were created in Spain, while the number of new homes started barely reached 300,000. Looking at different variables, the numbers suggest that the housing scarcity observed today was likely the norm in the 1900s until the economic boom of the 1960s. For this reason, we believe the number of inhabitants per home in the 1900s was likely higher than the average household size of 4.8 people.

Finally, we analyzed the total fertility rate as a method for generating reliable estimates. This metric has shown a trend similar to that of the number of inhabitants per home over the past century.

| Period     | Total Fertility Rate (TFR) | % change |
|------------|----------|---------|
| 1900  | 4.71     |  |
| 1910  | 4.43     | -5.94 |
| 1920  | 4.14     | -6.55 |
| 1930  | 3.63     | -12.32 |
| 1940  | 2.97     | -18.18 |
| 1950  | 2.46     | -17.17 |
| 1960  | 2.76     | 12.20 |
| 1970  | 2.88     | 4.35 |
| 1980  | 2.12     | -26.39 |
| 1990  | 1.35     | -36.32 |
| 2000  | 1.24     | -8.15 |
| 2010  | 1.37     | 10.48 |
| 2020  | 1.18     | -13.87 |

- ["_Estadisticas Historicas de España, siglo XIX - XX_" (2005, second edition), chapter 2: _Población, salud y actividad_, by Roser Nicolau, Page 83, Cuadro 2.2. Book coordinated by Albert Carreras and Xavier Tafunell, Fundación BBVA, ISBN: 84‑96515‑00‑1](https://www.fbbva.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dat/DE_2006_estadisticas_historicas.pdf).

The total fertility rate has steadily decreased from 1900 to the present day. Again, we can infer (albeit with some risk) that the number of inhabitants per home would have similarly declined. Applying a trend similar to that observed in the fertility rate to the number of inhabitants per home, we estimate there were approximately 5 to 7 inhabitants per home in 1900 (depending on the base year utilized).

After several iterations, we determined that the most suitable estimate for the number of inhabitants per house in 1900 is approximately 6 inhabitants per home. This choice exhibited a smooth downtrend that aligned well with historical data until connecting with current data.

| Year | Employed in construction (_Prados de la Escosura estimations until 1989_) | Workers needed per home (_own estimation until 1989_) | Inhabitants per home (own estimation until 1969) |
| ---- | ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1900 | 297.294 | 8,0 (est.) | 6,42 (est.) |
| 1910 | 311.753 | 8,0 (est.) | 6,09 (est.) |
| 1920 | 339.384 | 7,6 (est.) | 5,78 (est.) |
| 1930 | 482.369 | 7,2 (est.) | 5,56 (est.) |
| 1940 | 505.798 | 6,6 (est.) | 5,08 (est.) |
| 1950 | 758.773 | 6,1 (est.) | 4,66 (est.) |
| 1960 | 904.864 | 4,1 (est.) | 4,01 (est.) |
| 1970 | 1.285.694 | 3,5 (est.) | 3,17 |
| 1980 | 1.148.300 | 3,4 (est.) | 2,59 |
| 1990 | 1.276.000 | 3,9 | 2,30 |
| 2000 | 1.722.000 | 3,3 | 1,95 |
| 2010 | 1.651.000 | 8,3 | 1,85 |
| 2020 | 1.244.100 | 14,0 | 1,83 |

Overall, the final estimations suggest an initial requirement of 8 workers needed to produce 1 house in 1900, similar to the ratio observed in 2010. This would gradually decrease until reaching the well-sourced figure of 3.9 workers per house in the year 1990, following the historical minimum of 2000 during the Spanish housing bubble. After the burst of the bubble, productivity would have plummeted, resulting in the current ratio of 14 workers per house constructed.

Selecting an input per unit of output for the entire period was challenging, and it's essential to proceed with caution when interpreting these numbers. Further research is encouraged to refine these estimates. However, by analysing multiple variables, we believe the estimations provide a realistic depiction of the evolution of the housing stock.
