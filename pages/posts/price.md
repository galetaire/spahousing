# Annual evolution of housing prices

![Reload chart](/images/preuhistoric.png)

- **House prices in Spain since 1985**: in euros per square meter, inflation-adjusted (real price), unadjusted (nominal price), and accumulated inflation.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the average annual house price in Spain. Some brief observations:

- **Observation A**: The price of housing is constantly rising due to inflation, a consequence of current monetary policy.
- **Observation B**: The uptrend in house prices is however cyclical, with moments of expansion and recession, linked to debt cycles.
- **Observation C**: The cycles are easily visible if we look at the line representing the real price (inflation-adjusted). It allows us to see, for example, the magnitude of the real-estate bubble from the early 2000s.
