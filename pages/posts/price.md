# (a) Annual evolution of housing prices

[![Evolución precio de la vivienda](/images/priceyearly.png)](/images/priceyearly.png)

- **House price in Spain since 1986, in euros per square meter**: real price (inflation-adjusted, CPI Base 100 = 1986), unadjusted (nominal price), and accumulated inflation.

# Interpretation and observations

The prices are constantly rising due to inflation, a consequence of the current monetary policy. The uptrend is however cyclical, with major expansions and minor regressions. The cycles are visible if we look at the real price (inflation-adjusted). It allows us to see, for example, the real-estate bubble from the early 2000s.

# (b) Quarterly evolution of housing prices

 [![Evolución precio de la vivienda](/images/pricequarterly.png)](/images/pricequarterly.png)

- **Left axis (line)**: house price in euros per square meter, according to Idealista and to the notaries.
- **Right axis (area)**: Percentage of difference (in absolute value) between the two compared price sources.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above compares Idealista and notary prices. Both trends are very similar. However, the notary price tends to be always below the Idealista price. This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the Idealista price shows the price proposed by the seller, while the notary price shows the price paid by the buyer.

The _"Spread"_ and the _"Sharp change"_ are intended to serve as signals to capture trend changes.

- **Differential or Spread**: The grey bars (right axis) simply show the difference between the two prices in %. The two lines should not be too far apart, as they represent the same information.

- **Sharp change**: The green line shows the variation of the notarial price compared to the Idealista trend. The line can move away from the Idealista price both upwards and downwards. For example, in 2010-2012 there are a couple of visible moments when it moves clearly downwards, suggesting that the downward pressure is strong.
