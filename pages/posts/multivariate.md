# Multivariate model: housing overview

[![Datos del mercado inmobiliario](/images/multivariate.png)](/images/multivariate.png)

- **Unemployment, Inflation and Real price**: average rate for the given year. **Population, Mortgages, Home sales and Nominal price**: percentage of annual change compared to the previous year.

# Interpretation and observations

The model groups together seven variables: price (real and nominal), sales, inflation, credit, demographics and employment. A couple of observations:

- **Observation A**: When unemployment increases, the price of housing tends to decrease.
- **Observation B**: Inflation has been following a decreasing trend, at least until 2020.
- **Observation C**: Between 2000 and 2008 the population increased rapidly, due to immigration.
- **Observation D**: Between 1986 and 1990 the rise in prices was very high, both in nominal and real terms, due to inflation.
