# Multivariate model: housing overview

[![Datos del mercado inmobiliario](/images/multivariate.png)](/images/multivariate.png)

- **Unemployment and Inflation**: average rate for the given year. **Population, Mortgages, Home sales, Real price and Nominal price**: percentage of annual change compared to the previous year.

# Interpretation and observations

The model groups together seven essential variables: price (real and nominal), volume, inflation, credit, demographics and employment. A couple of observations from the chart:

- **Observation A**: Inflation followed a decreasing trend from 1986 to 2020.
- **Observation B**: Between 2001 and 2008, the population increased due to an immigration wave.
- **Observation C**: When unemployment increases, the price of housing tends to decrease.
- **Observation D**: The black bar informs us of the price movement in nominal terms. For example, between 1986 and 1990 the rise in house prices was very high, due to inflation.
- **Observation E**: The orange bar, real price, informs us of the de/revaluation of housing. For example, in 2012, there was a strong devaluation, and in 2017 a strong revaluation.
