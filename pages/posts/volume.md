# Evolution of home sales

![Reload chart](/images/compravenda.png)

- **Left axis (bars)**: total number of home sales in each quarter.
- **Right axis (line)**: housing prices in euros per square meter.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the number of home sales per quarter. The color indicates whether the number of sales is lower than the previous quarter (red) or higher (green). The black line represents the notarial price. Thus, we can see if the number of sales is going up or down, in combination with price movement. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Between 2007 and 2013 the number of sales follows a downward trend, chaining 5 red bars in a row.
- **Observation B**: Between 2014 and 2019 the trend changes and the number of sales rises, chaining 3 consecutive green bars twice.
