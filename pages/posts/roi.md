- **Housing return on investment (%)**: considers both gross asset appreciation and net rental return.
  - **Bars**: green bars denote positive appreciation; red bars denote negative appreciation.
  - **Red line**: annual inflation rate, represented in percentage.

# Interpretation and observations

By looking at the housing appreciation, i.e. whether if houses increase or decrease in value year over year. We can distinguish several outstanding periods:

- 1986 - 1990: Strong revaluation.
- 1991 - 1993: Stagnation.
- 1994 - 2007: Steady revaluation.
- 2008 - 2013: Strong devaluation.
- 2014 - 2019: Moderate revaluation.
- 2020 - 2022: Covid-19, impact and rebound.

- **Price-to-rent ratio (%, net and gross)**: annual percentage of housing rental return in Spain.

- **Price-to-rent ratio (time, net and gross)**: number of years to fully recover a home purchase in Spain.

# Interpretation and observations

The charts from above show the ratio between the purchase price and the rental price (both in %; and in time, years). In essence, it's an indicator similar to the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) used in the stock market analysis. It can be interpreted as follows:

- At 2010 prices, it took 27.8 years to fully recover a house purchase through rental returns, at a 3.6% annual rental return.
- At 2020 prices, it took 17.5 years to fully recover a house purchase through rental returns, at a 5.7% annual rental return.
