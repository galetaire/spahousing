# How much it costs building in Spain?

There is no definitive answer since Spain offers a great degree of variability in terms of prices. It is not the same to build in Ibiza than in Guadalajara, not only because workforce and materials are priced differently, but because taxes also vary widely.

Anyway, if you are an individual interested in building in Spain, here you have the things (sections and subsections) you must be aware of when building a house. A few notes:

- The price doesn't cover the land, which also varies widely. But as a safe point, consider a decent plot of land in a good location to be around 150.000 €. If you don't own land, you must add this amount to the building budget.
- The price doesn't cover mortgage costs or any sort of financial instrument to ease the payment of the house. If you don't have enough liquid capital, you must add the mortgage cost to the building budget.

The most determinant subsection in the table is the PEM (Material Execution Budget), which represents the approximate cost in euros of building one square meter. It usually goes from 1.000 to 2.000 eu/m2, depending on *where are you building*, the *architectural complexity*, *how big is the house* and the *qualities of materials*.

Our base case for the numbers of table is: *average location*, *minimal architectural complexities*, *100 square meters* and *medium-low qualities*.
