# How much it costs building in Spain?

- *Cost of the house + taxes = 230,000 €*
- *Cost of mortgage + taxes = 88,000 €*
- *Cost of land + taxes = 150,000 €*
- *Average cost of building in Spain =*
  - *370,000 €, without mortgage*
  - *468,000 €, with mortgage*

**The cost of building an average house in Spain is 370,000 euros**. However, this price is just a general approximation since Spain offers a great degree of variability in terms of prices. Building in Ibiza is not the same as building in Guadalajara, not only because the workforce and materials are priced differently, but also because taxes can differ.

If you are an individual interested in building in Spain, below in the table you will find the aspects (sections and subsections) you must be aware of when building a house. A few notes:

- The price does not cover the cost of the land, which also varies widely. As a rough estimate, consider a decent plot of land in a good location to be around 150,000 €. If you do not own land, you must add this amount to the building budget.
- The price does not cover mortgage costs or any sort of financial instrument to ease the payment of the house. If you do not have enough liquid capital, you must add the mortgage cost to the building budget.

The most significant subsection in the table is the PEM (*Material Execution Budget*), which represents the approximate cost in euros of building one square meter. It usually ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 €/m², depending on *where are you building*, the *architectural complexity*, *the size of the house* and the *quality of materials*.

Our base case for the numbers in the table are: *moderately good location*, *minimal architectural complexities*, *100 square meters* and *medium quality materials*.
