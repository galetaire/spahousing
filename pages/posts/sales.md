# (a) Annual evolution of home sales

[![Compraventa de vivienda](/images/salesyearly1.png)](/images/salesyearly1.png)

- **Purchasing-age population (PAP)**: home sales (bars); population between 25 and 50 years old (black lines); and housing inheritances (purple bars).

The [PAP housing index](papindex) draws two ceilings based on demographics. The higher one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house individually, and the lower one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house as a couple.

- If sales exceed the upper limit, could be interpreted as a **bubble**.
- If sales are below the lower limit, could be interpreted as a **depression**.
- If sales are in between the two ceilings, the market is in an **optimal zone**.

# (b) Quarterly evolution of home sales

[![Compraventas de vivienda](/images/salesquarterly.png)](/images/salesquarterly.png)

- **Left axis (bars)**: total number of home sales in each quarter.
- **Right axis (line)**: housing price index.

The color indicates whether the number of sales is lower than the previous quarter (red) or higher (green). The black line represents the HPI price.
