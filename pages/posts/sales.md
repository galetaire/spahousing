# (a) Annual evolution of home sales

[![Compraventa de vivienda](/images/salesyearly1.png)](/images/salesyearly1.png)

- **Purchasing-age population (PAP)**: home sales (bars); population between 25 and 50 years old (dotted lines); and housing inheritances (purple line).

- **PAP disaggregated**: home sales (bars); population of 30, 40 and 50 years old (colored dotted lines); and housing inheritances (purple bars).

# Interpretation and observations

The _PAP housing index_ draws two ceilings based on demographics. The higher one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house individually, and the lower one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house as a couple.

- If the number of sales exceeds the upper limit, it implies that the situation corresponds to a **bubble**, e.g. 2004 - 2007.
- If the number of sales is below the lower limit, it implies that there is a **depression**, e.g. 2011 - 2014.
- If the number of sales is in between the two ceilings, it implies that the market is near an **optimal zone**.

# (b) Quarterly evolution of home sales

- **Left axis (bars)**: total number of home sales in each quarter.
- **Right axis (line)**: housing price index.

# Interpretation and observations

The color indicates whether the number of sales is lower than the previous quarter (red) or higher (green). The black line represents the HPI price. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Between 2007 and 2013 the number of sales followed a downward trend, chaining 5 red bars in a row.
- **Observation B**: In 2020 sales plummet as a result of the Covid-19 lockdowns.
- **Observation C**: Between 2014 and 2021 the trend changes and the number of sales rises, chaining 3 consecutive green bars in 2018, and 5 in 2021.
