# Annual evolution of home sales

[![Compraventa de vivienda](/images/salesyearly1.png)](/images/salesyearly1.png)

- **Purchasing-age population (PAP)**: Home sales (bars); population between 25 and 50 years old (dotted lines); and housing inheritances (purple line).

- **PAP disaggregated**: Home sales (bars); population of 30, 40 and 50 years old (colored dotted lines); and housing inheritances (purple bars).

# Interpretation and observations

The _PAP housing index_ is an indicator to analyze the housing market condition. It draws two ceilings based on demographics. The higher one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house individually, and the lower one assumes that everyone at some point will buy a house as a couple.

- If the number of sales exceeds the upper limit, it implies that the situation corresponds to a **bubble**, e.g. 2004 - 2007.
- If the number of sales is below the lower limit, it implies that there is a **depression**, e.g. 2011 - 2014.
- If the number of sales is in between the two ceilings, it implies that the market is in an **optimal zone**. Being possible to denote a **higher** (if the bars are above the optimal line), or a **lower** demand (if the bars are below the optimal line).

# Quarterly evolution of home sales

- **Left axis (bars)**: total number of home sales in each quarter.
- **Right axis (line)**: housing price index.

# Interpretation and observations

The chart from above shows the number of home sales per quarter. The color indicates whether the number of sales is lower than the previous quarter (red) or higher (green). The black line represents the HPI price. Thus, we can see if the number of sales is going up or down, in combination with price movement. Some observations:

- **Observation A**: Between 2007 and 2013 the number of sales followed a downward trend, chaining 5 red bars in a row.
- **Observation B**: In 2020 sales plummet as a result of the Covid-19 lockdowns.
- **Observation C**: Between 2014 and 2021 the trend changes and the number of sales rises, chaining 3 consecutive green bars in 2018, and 5 in 2021.
