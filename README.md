# About the database 

Even so I try to be cautious and avoid mistakes, errors can occur, so I encourage the review and verification of the database. If encountered any, the creation of ``Issues`` and ``Pull requests`` for the database are welcome, you can also reach me through various channels.

The database can be found in [spahousing/public/docs/](https://github.com/galetaire/spahousing/tree/main/public/docs), presented in four different file formats.
  - [spain_stats_ods.ods](https://github.com/galetaire/spahousing/blob/main/public/docs/spain_stats_ods.ods)
  - [spain_stats_xlsx.xlsx](https://github.com/galetaire/spahousing/blob/main/public/docs/spain_stats_xlsx.xlsx)
  - [spain_stats_csv.csv](https://github.com/galetaire/spahousing/blob/main/public/docs/spain_stats_csv.csv)
  - [spain_stats_xml.xml](https://github.com/galetaire/spahousing/blob/main/public/docs/spain_stats_xml.xml)

Full review and modification is better to be done in ``.ods`` or ``.xlsx``, since some indicators are originated from other internal indicators, and the formulas can only be seen and edited in the two mentioned formats.
